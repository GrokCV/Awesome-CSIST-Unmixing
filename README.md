# Awesome Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target Unmixing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome resources (papers, codes, datasets, etc.) for Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target Unmixing (CSIST Unmixing).

**Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target Unmixing (CSIST Unmixing)** is a critical and challenging task in infrared search and track (IRST) systems. It focuses on separating and detecting multiple small, dim targets that are located very close to each other in the focal plane array, which often leads to them being perceived as a single blob. This repository aims to collect and organize the latest advances in this specific field.

## Datasets and Benchmarks
*(This is crucial for a data-driven field. Provide details on how to access and use them.)*

-   **CSIST-100K** - A large-scale synthetic dataset (100k samples) for closely-spaced IR point target unmixing. Simulates 1-5 targets/image with a PSF of œÉ=0.5px, min separation ‚â•0.52 Rayleigh units, and random intensity. Targets overlap significantly in a 3√ó3 area, posing a strong challenge for counting and localization. (80k/10k/10k split).

-   **SeqCSIST** - Sequential Closely-Spaced Infrared Small Target Unmixing \
    *A sequential benchmark dataset for sequential closely-spaced infrared small target unmixing. A synthetic dataset which is generated with an image size of 11 √ó 11 pixels. Each image contains two to four targets, with intensities randomly sampled from the range. The targets follow random trajectories. Targets are rendered based on the 84% energy concentration resolution standard and a diffusion variance of 0.5 pixels. The ground truth, including the precise coordinates and intensity for each target, is provided in corresponding XML files.* \

## Evaluation Metrics
*(Explain the common metrics used to evaluate unmixing performance in your field.)*

-   **CSO-mAP**: The mean Average Precision over multiple sub-pixel distance thresholds (Œ¥=0.05 to 0.25px). Designed to evaluate precise localization in scenarios where targets are closer than the Rayleigh criterion, where standard metrics fail.
